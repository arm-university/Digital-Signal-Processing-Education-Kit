## Modified Material by Academics

Whilst we encourage authors to fork our repository and submit a pull request so that these can be reviewed and merged back to our main version of the Digital Signal Processing Education Kit residing in `main` branch, there may be situations where the adaptation necessarily diverges from the main version and it makes more sense to be left as a standalone GitHub repository maintained by the author. 

Therefore, the Arm Education Digital Signal Processing Education Kit repository also contains a separate `uni-adapted` branch where we share standalone GitHub repositories of teaching material adapted and modified by authors and academics from various universities.  

The standalone GitHub repositories of adapted material are added as subfolders in this `uni-adapted` branch using `git subtree`. We would usually pull in the latest changes from the original standalone GitHub respositories after a quality check, therefore the subfolders in this branch may not contain the latest material. Please refer to the original GitHub repository links mentioned in the summary table below for the latest version.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This content may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community. 

If you are adapting material from this branch, we encourage you to use inclusive terminology. We also encourage you to reach out to the original content authors to report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage.
